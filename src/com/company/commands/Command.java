/**
 * This class is part of the Divina Commedia simulator application.
 *
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command currently consists of four strings: a command word other four
 * words,(for example, if the command was "use bucket on river", then the four strings
 * obviously are "use", "bucket", "on" and"river").
 *
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the command word is <null>.
 *
 * If the command had only one word, then the other words are <null>.
